# [Work in Progress] Blog for Tech Regular

## Current Issue(s):

I have built out up to spitting PostContent out onto the page. However, things are not working as expected. I have two issues (that I'm currently aware of): 
1) The images embeded within my rich text coming from contentful are not being spat out onto the page
2) The root blog post list is clickable and opens the correct URL w/ slug attached. However, the content on the page is coming from JUST the most recently published post. I need to figure out how to get the content from other post as well.
