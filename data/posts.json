To complete this process, I suggest taking a picture of your desk and looking at it over a period of several days. Really consider how often you use everything on it. If you only use something on your desk once or twice a month, consider putting it away or moving it to somewhere more out-of-sight until you need it again. Another strategy for identifying what you do or do not need is to take a day or week to keep a tally of the times you use something in the week. If you use something more than 10 or 15 times in a day, keep it. If not, think about moving it.",

If you are using a cheaper Ikea desk during this time, it is important to be careful not to strip any holes that you create in the “wood.” If you have any hard drives that you don’t need direct access to, you can also mount those into place using a wire paper tray and mug hooks.

I am one of those people who don't really like light too much, but I am also--unfortunately--the type of person who enjoys seeing things. Having the hue bulbs set to their lowest setting is the perfect amount of light to allow some essential functions, while still allowing the RGB LEDs on the rear of my desk to light up behind the monitors beautifully.",

The other problem I have with the bulbs is that the Hub has to be connected directly to my router which is placed quite far from my office. Being that far away has apparently caused the bulbs to drop out of range periodically. Last night I spent about 5-10 minutes sitting in my office attempting to get the bulbs to dim on my phone.

However, by replacing my case and a few other parts (for just around $200), I am able to upgrade my system later on and still utilize a few of the pieces that I purchased for my budget upgrade.

When I picked up this keyboard new, it cost me upwards of $100. Now, budget seekers can pick up an Ultimate 2014 for a fraction of the original price from resellers on sites like EBay. With Razer’s Orange key switches and its sturdy construction, the Blackwidow Ultimate 2014 is an excellent investment for someone looking for a quality board—though less flashy board—for a budget price. Were it not for my desire for an RGB board, this particular product would have likely been a part of my setup for several more years to come!",

The smart plugs provide a way to eliminate that inefficiency entirely. By setting my office plugs to a general schedule, I am able to limit power draw to scheduled times when I am likely to use the electronics that are utilizing the electronics.

Prior to my network upgrade, I was using my ISPs provided gateway/router to provide my home with Wi-Fi. However, due to its poop signal dispersion, my office was on the outside of the gateway’s range, making Wi-Fi an issue in the office. My computer (placed on the very outside of the signal) with it’s entry level Wi-Fi adapter (I feel like I’m saying Wi-Fi a lot. I guess that’s the hazard of an article like this…) was able to pick up enough of a signal to get the job done most of the time. However, when I used the Mini Smart Plug in a location slightly closer to the gateway, it very regularly dropped the signal, and when using the larger sized plug in a location just a bit further from the gateway, it dropped signal intermittently as well. Admittedly, this is not the fault of the plug, but instead of the terrible wireless networking configuration I had at the time, but it is good to know for those of you with less-than ideal home Wi-Fi setups.",

I've even been a co-host on a podcast that focused on a particular Ubisoft title released last year. However, when it came to the amount of time that I am willing and able to dedicate to content production, none of my outlets worked in the least.",

However, due to my limited income, I reluctantly admitted that I couldn't do exactly what everyone else was doing. I couldn't go out and buy the newest technology and computer hardware because my wallet--and significant other--wouldn't allow me. ",

While many of these products may be a little older or a generation or so behind the current batch of products, I think the tech community needs a current opinion on what may have been reviewed by other tech-tubers several months or years ago.
